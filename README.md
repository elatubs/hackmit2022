# hackmit2022

This application was built in twenty-four hours by Robin Liu, Ella Tubbs, Andrew Cai, and Cindy Kim for HackMIT 2022. 

The project idea was inspired by the many places on MIT Campus and beyond that we inhabit daily to study and a desire for a intuitive solution that enables sharing study spaces and emphasizes collaborative work.

# How It Works:

Create a group session code and share it with your friends. Once your group joins the map, each individual can place themselves on the map when they are in a study space. The app uses a geolocation API paired with the Google Maps API to place the user on the map only when they press "Put me on the map!". Other users on the map can view who is nearby. 

# Contribute to StudSpaces!

Because StudSpaces was built in one day, there is a lot that can be contributed! In order of importance: 

1) Verifying group session codes, and prompting user to create a new code if their session code is incorrect 
2) Allowing users to choose their own avatar that becomes their custom marker and add what they are working on to their marker 
3) Allowing the group to name their study map 
4) General UX/UI improvements 

With love, 
Robin, Ella, Andrew, and Cindy
